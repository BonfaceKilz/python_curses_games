This project aims to implement some games in the terminal using python.
So far basic implementations of the following games have been done:

- Snake
- Tetris
- Racing

To start the games:

`python main.py`

Some games have been implemented as runnable modules, so you can try:

`python -m games.race`   

to start the racing game.
