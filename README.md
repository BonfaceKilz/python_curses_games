# Terminal Games
This project aims to make some games work from the terminal using python
and its curses module. The following games are working:

- Snake
- Tetris
- Racing

To start the games:

`python main.py`

Some games have been implemented as runnable modules, so you can try:

- `python -m games.race`: to start the racing game.
- `python -m games.tetris`: to start the tetris game.
- `python -m games.snake`: to start the snake game.

## Instructions
- Arrow keys or h,j,k,l (vim key bindings): General motion keys
- p: pausing a game
- q: quiting a game (The game cannot be quit if it has been paused)
- UP/r: rotate block in tetris

## Games in the Pipeline
